## 🎯 The Problem

[2-3 sentences explaining the problem this project solves. What pain point does it address? Why does this matter?]

Example:
> Traditional Groupon coupons lose value after expiration and can't be transferred. Merchants struggle with inflexible discount strategies, and consumers can't recoup value from unused deals. This creates inefficiency and waste in the local deals market.

---

## ✨ The Solution

[3-5 bullet points explaining your solution approach and key features]

**Example:**
- 🎟️ **NFT Coupons** - Every deal becomes a tradable Solana NFT
- 💰 **Secondary Market** - Sell unused coupons to recover value
- 🔄 **Dynamic Pricing** - Coupon value adjusts based on demand
- 🏪 **Merchant Dashboard** - Real-time analytics and flexible campaigns
- ⛓️ **On-Chain Verification** - Transparent, tamper-proof redemption
